-- Resolve funnel data against ALL events (active + inactive), not just active.
--
-- Before: the get_analytics_summary RPC's `ev` CTE filtered `is_active = true`,
-- so funnel rows only existed for active events. Inactive ("hidden") events
-- never appeared in the funnel sections at all. The admin wants to optionally
-- view those via a checkbox; for that the data has to exist. Active events are
-- still shown by default client-side — inactive ones are toggled on.
--
-- Titles are distinct across the events table, so the id-then-title resolution
-- stays deterministic and active events' numbers are unchanged.
