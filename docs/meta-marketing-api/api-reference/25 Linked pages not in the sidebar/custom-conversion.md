# Custom Conversions

Beginning September 2, 2025, we will start to roll out more proactive restrictions on custom conversions that may suggest information not permitted under [our terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/businesstools?_rdr). For example, any custom conversion suggesting specific health conditions (e.g., "arthritis", "diabetes") or financial status (e.g., "credit score", "high income") will be flagged and prevented from being used to run ad campaigns.

**What these restrictions mean for your campaigns:**

* You won’t be able to use flagged custom conversions when creating new campaigns.
* If you have an active campaign using flagged custom conversions, you should either create a new campaign or duplicate your campaign and use a non-impacted custom conversion to avoid performance and optimization issues.

**For API developers:**

* Beginning September 2, 2025, the field `is_unavailable` will return `true` to signal if your custom conversions have been flagged.

More information on this update and how to resolve flagged custom conversions can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2455915321411996).

Optimize ads delivery based on online and offline conversion events that you define. Track activity without adding new events Meta Pixel. Custom conversions objects are associated with an [Ad Account](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/ad-account). Use them to describe events you want to measure and events you want to track to optimize ads delivery.

Specify actions that are different from the nine standard events. See also [Meta Pixel](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/facebook-pixel), [Conversion Tracking with Meta Pixel](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/facebook-pixel/conversion-tracking) and [Promoted Object](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/ad-campaign/promoted-object).

**You need standard API access for this endpoint. See [Marketing API, Access Levels](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/access).**

For example, define a `PURCHASE` conversion as an event occuring when someone visits certain pages such as `thankyou.html` or `confirmation.html`:

```
curl \
-F 'name=URL based Custom Conversion' \
-F 'event_source_id=<FB_PIXEL_ID>' \
-F 'rule={"or":[{"url":{"i_contains": "thankyou.html"}},{"url":{"i_contains":"confirmation.html"}}]}' \
-F 'custom_event_type=PURCHASE' \
-F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
'https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/customconversions'
```

In this example, events occur if someone visits those two `.html` pages, case-insensitive of the page name and extention.

### Limitations

Note that the maximum number of custom conversions you can have per ad account is 100.

If you use the Ads Insights API to get metrics on custom conversions, be aware of these limitations:

* Getting product ID breakdowns are not supported.
* Getting unique action counts are not supported.

## Reading

Custom conversions on Facebook allows you to optimize and track actions without having to add anything to your Facebook pixel base code. They also allow you to optimize for and track actions that are different from the 9 standard events that come with the Facebook pixel.

List of custom conversions for an account:

```
curl -G \
-d 'fields=["pixel","rule","custom_event_type"]' \
-d "access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/customconversions
```

### Flagged custom conversions

 If a custom conversion is flagged, the `is_unavailable` field will be set to `true`.

```

{
  "is_unavailable": true,
  "id": "30141209892193360"
}

```

Attempting to modify the flagged custom conversion will result in an error:

```

{
  "error": {
    "message": "Your custom audience is currently blocked",
    "code": 2700000,
    "error_subcode": 2460004,
    "error_user_title": "Your custom conversion is currently blocked",
    "error_user_msg": "This custom conversion is blocked because it may contain information (e.g., health, financial) not allowed under Meta’s terms. Visit the events manager to appeal this decision, edit your custom conversion and remove prohibited  information, or choose a different custom conversion.",
  },
}

```

**To resolve flagged custom conversions**
 If any of your custom conversions are flagged for suggesting information that is not allowed under our terms, you may want to consider the following options:

 To resolve a flagged custom conversion in a new campaign creation:

* **Create new custom conversion**: Use a new custom conversion and make sure that it does not include information that is not allowed under our terms.

* **Choose a different custom conversion**: Select a different existing custom conversion and make sure it does not include information that is not allowed under our terms

 To resolve a flagged custom conversion in an existing campaign:

* **Duplicate your campaign and select an existing custom conversion**: If you have a running campaign that is flagged due to a flagged custom conversion, consider duplicating the campaign and selecting a different custom conversion that is not flagged before publishing the new duplicated campaign. **Note:** Once the campaign is published, you cannot remove or select a different custom conversion.

**Request a review**
 If you believe your custom conversion has been flagged in error and doesn't include non-permitted information, you can request a review via Ads Manager under the campaigns table, or in Events Manager under the custom conversions page.

### Examples

Defines a high-value `PURCHASE` when someone triggers the `Purchase` standard event and purchase `value` is greater than 100:

```
curl \
-F 'name=High value Purchase Custom Conversion' \
-F 'event_source_id=<FB_PIXEL_ID>' \
-F 'rule={"and":[{"event":{"eq": "Purchase"}},{"value":{"gt":100}}]}' \
-F 'custom_event_type=PURCHASE' \
-F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
'https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/customconversions'
```

Define a custom event then build a custom conversion for it. Specify a `PURCHASE` conversion that to track when a user-defined, `item-sold` custom event occurs. Track when someone purchases an item in a certain color.

Step 1: Define `item-sold` custom event in Facebook pixel on your website:

```
fbq('trackCustom', 'item-sold', {
   color: 'black',
   value: 1.00,
   currency: 'USD'
});
```

Step 2: Provide a `PURCHASE` conversion for the `item-sold` custom event for a given `color` by specifying it as a custom parameter:

```
curl \
-F 'name=Item Sold Custom Conversion' \
-F 'event_source_id=<FB_PIXEL_ID>' \
-F 'rule={"and":[{"event":{"eq": "item-sold"}},{"color":{"i_contains":"black"}}]}' \
-F 'custom_event_type=PURCHASE' \
-F 'access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
'https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/act_<AD_ACCOUNT_ID>/customconversions'
```
